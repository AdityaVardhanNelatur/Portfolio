## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a Full-Stack Developer (MERN) with hands-on experience building secure and scalable web applications using **React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**.  
I have implemented **JWT-based authentication**, **RESTful APIs**, and optimized **CRUD operations** in real-world projects.

I also have a strong foundation in **Machine Learning**, gained during my **AI/ML Internship at Edunet Foundation**, where I worked on ML pipelines, data preprocessing, and large datasets.
